Changes since last release
________________________

Most of this release's changes were done to bring AfterStep Classic 1.1b4 to feature parity with 1.1b2.
1. This release includes a config file in the format used in Fvwm3 1.0. Fvwm2rc still updated.
2. The Wharf is resized so that the old AfterStep Classic tiles work, it looks like 1.1b2 now.
3. The Wharf rolls up now, press the AfterStep button to roll/unroll the Wharf. Thanks Fvwm Forum user Rasat for this!
4. Root menu remaned to "Hotlist", as it was done in 1.1b2. More work remains to be done on the root menu.
5. Iconify/Uniconify icons uses the Zoom effect, like in 1.1b2.
6. Cleaned up the config files, simplified some syntax.
