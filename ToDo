** This is a non-exhaustive list of to do items for the next release: **
1. Upload updated FVWM2RC, this will include a newly resized Wharf.
2. Upload tiles, these tiles are the background to the Wharf buttons that make it more AfterStep-y.
3. Upload the original tarballs of AfterStep Classic 1.1b1 and 1.1b2
4. Find a way to autohide the Wharf like what was possible in 1.1b2
Sometime in a mysterious future release:
1. Fix the the root menu to be more like AfterStep Classic.
2. Custom default wallpaper.
